    "\n",
    "In the first part of this exercise, we will take a look at shape complation using [3D-EPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00101). This approach was also introduced in the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization below shows an overview of the method: From an incomplete shape observation (which you would get when scanning an object with a depth sensor for example), we use a 3D encoder-predictor network that first encodes the incomplete shapes into a common latent space using several 3D convolution layers and then decodes them again using multiple 3D transpose convolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we get from a 32^3 SDF voxel grid to a 32^3 DF (unsigned) voxel grid that represents the completed shape. We only focus on this part here; in the original implementation, this 32^3 completed prediction would then be further improved (in an offline step after inference) by sampling parts from a shape database to get the final resolution to 128^3.\n",

    "### (a) Downloading the data\n",
    "We will use the original dataset used in the official implementation. It consists of SDF and DF grids (representing incomplete input data and complete target data) with a resolution of 32^3 each. Each input-target pair is generated from a ShapeNet shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incomplete SDF data are generated by sampling virtual camera trajectories around every object. Each trajectory is assigned an ID which is part of the file names (see below). The camera views for each trajectory are combined into a common SDF grid by volumetric fusion. It is easy to generate an SDF here since we know both camera location and object surface: Everything between camera and surface is known free space and outside the object, leading to a positive SDF sign. Everything behind the surface has a negative sign. For the complete shapes, however, deciding whether a voxel in the DF grid is inside or outside an object is not a trivial problem. This is why we use unsigned distance fields as target and prediction representation instead. This still encodes the distance to the closest surface but does not contain explicit information about the inside/outside location.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of dataset layout, we follow the ShapeNet directory structure as seen in the last exercise:\n",
    "Each folder in the `exercise_3/data/shapenet_dim32_sdf` and `exercise_3/data/shapenet_dim32_df` directories contains one shape category represented by a number, e.g. `02691156`.\n",
    "We provide the mapping between these numbers and the corresponding names in `exercise_3/data/shape_info.json`. Each of these shape category folders contains lots of shapes in sdf or df format. In addition to that, every shape now also contains multiple trajectories: 0 to 7, encoded as `__0__` to `__7__`. These 8 files are just different input representations, meaning they vary in the level of completeness and location of missing parts; they all map to the `.df` file with corresponding shape ID and `__0__` at the end.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset implementation follows the same general structure as in exercise 2. We prepared an initial implementation already in `exercise_3/data/shapenet.py`; your task is to resolve all TODOs there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for SDFs and DFs in `.sdf`/`.df` files are stored in binary form as follows:\n",

    "dimX    #uint64 \n",
    "dimY    #uint64 \n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "You have to take care of three important steps before returning the SDF and DF for the corresponding `index` in `__getitem__`:\n",
    "1. **Truncation**: 3D-EPN uses a truncated SDF which means that for each voxel, the distance to the closest surface will be clamped to a max absolute value. This is helpful since we do not care about longer distances (Marching Cubes only cares about distances close to the surface). It allows us to focus our predictions on the voxels near the surface. We use a `truncation_distance` of 3 (voxels) which means we expect to get an SDF with values between -3 and 3 as input to the model.\n",
    "2. **Separation** of distances and sign: 3D-EPN uses as input a 2x32x32x32 SDF grid, with absolute distance values of the SDF in channel 0 and the signs (-1 or 1) in channel 1.\n",
    "3. **Log** scaling: We scale targets and prediction with a log operation to further guide predictions to focus on the surface voxels. Therefore, you should return target DFs as `log(df + 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: An easy way to load the data from `.sdf` and `.df` files is to use `np.fromfile`. First, load the dimensions, then the data, then reshape everything into the shape you loaded in the beginning. Make sure you get the datatypes and byte offsets right! If you are using the zip version of the dataset as explained above, you should use `np.frombuffer` instead of `np.fromfile` to load from the `data`-buffer. The syntax is identical."

    "<img src=\"exercise_3/images/3depn.png\" alt=\"3D-EPN Architecture\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we simplify the model by omitting the classification part - this will not have a big impact since most of the shape completion performance comes from the 3D encoder-decoder unet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of three parts: The encoder, the bottleneck, and the decoder. Encoder and decoder are constructed with the same architecture, just mirrored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of each part are:\n",
    "- **Encoder**: 4 layers, each one containing a 3D convolution (with kernel size 4, as seen in the visualization), a 3D batch norm (except the very first layer), and a leaky ReLU with a negative slope of 0.2. Our goal is to reduce the spatial dimension from 32x32x32 to 1x1x1 and to get the feature dimension from 2 (absolute values and sign) to `num_features * 8`. We do this by using a stride of 2 and padding of 1 for all convolutions except for the last one where we use a stride of 1 and no padding. The feature channels are increased from 2 to `num_features` in the first layer and then doubled with every subsequent layer.\n",
    "- **Decoder**: Same architecture as encoder, just mirrored: Going from `num_features * 8 * 2` (the 2 will be explained later) to 1 (the DF values). The spatial dimensions go from 1x1x1 to 32x32x32. Each layer use a 3D Transpose convolution now, together with 3D batch norm and ReLU (no leaky ReLUs anymore). Note that the last layer uses neither Batch Norms nor a ReLU since we do not want to constrain the range of possible values for the prediction.\n",
    "- **Bottleneck**: This is realized with 2 fully connected layers, each one going from a vector of size 640 (which is `num_features * 8`) to a vector of size 640. Each such layer is followed by a ReLU activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some minor details:\n",
    "- **Skip connections** allow the decoder to use information from the encoder and also improve gradient flow. We use it here to connect the output of encoder layer 1 to decoder layer 4, the output of encoder layer 2 to decoder layer 3, and so on. This means that the input to a decoder layer is the concatenation of the previous decoder output with the corresponding encoder output, along the feature dimension. Hence, the number of input features for each decoder layer are twice those of the encoder layers, as mentioned above.\n",
    "- **Log scaling**: You also need to scale the final outputs of the network logarithmically: `out = log(out + 1)`. This is the same transformation you applied to the target shapes in the dataloader before and ensures that prediction and target volumes are comparable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we will take a look at 3D-reconstruction using [DeepSDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05103). We recommend reading the paper before attempting the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSDF is an auto-decoder based approach that learns a continuous SDF representation for a class of shapes. Once trained, it can be used for shape representation, interpolation and shape completion. We'll look at each of these\n",
    "applications.\n",

    "<img src=\"exercise_3/images/deepsdf_teaser.png\" alt=\"deepsdf_teaser\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n",

    "During training, the autodecoder optimizes both the network parameters and the latent codes representing each of the training shapes. Once trained, to reconstruct a shape given its SDF observations, a latent code is\n",
    "optimized keeping the network parameters fixed, such that the optimized latent code gives the lowest error with observed SDF values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage that implicit representations have over voxel/grid based approaches is that they are not tied to a particular grid resolution, and can be evaluated at any resolution once trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to previous exercise, we'll first download the processed dataset, look at the implementation of the dataset, the model and the trainer, try out overfitting and generalization over the entire dataset, and finally inference on unseen samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (a) Downloading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas volumetric models output entire 3d shape representations, implicit models like DeepSDF work on per point basis. The network takes in a 3D-coordinate (and additionally the latent vector) and outputs the SDF value at the queried point. To train such a model,\n",
    "we therefore need, for each of the training shapes, a bunch of points with their corresponding SDF values for supervision. Points are sampled more aggressively near the surface of the object as we want to capture a more detailed SDF near the surface. For those curious,\n",
    "data preparation is decribed in more detail in section 5 of the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the ShapeNet Sofa class for the experiments in this exercise. We've already prepared this data, so that you don't need to deal with the preprocessing. For each shape, the following files are provided:\n",
    "- `mesh.obj` representing the mesh representation of the shape\n",
    "- `sdf.npz` file containing large number of points sampled on and around the mesh and their sdf values; contains numpy arrays under keys \"pos\" and \"neg\", containing points with positive and negative sdf values respectively\n",
