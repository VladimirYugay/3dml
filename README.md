# 3dml
This repository contains code for various 3D ML topics starting from 3D object representations and ending with ML models operating on top of 3D shapes 

E1 contains following implementations:


    * Signed distance fields and their compositions 
    * Signed distance fields on grids
    * Signed distance fields to occupancy grids conversion 
    * Signed distance fields to traingle meshes conversion 
    * Implicit functions
    * Marching Cubes algorithm implementation 
    * Triangle meshes as Wavefront OBJ
    * Triangle meshes to Point Clouds conversion 
    * Rigid Shape Alignment
